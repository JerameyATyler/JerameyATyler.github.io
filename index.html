                Sometimes bad things happen. When they do many of us feel like we can't do anything that can make a
                difference. We don't see how big of an impact we can make if we just don't give up. A problem can seem
                huge, but if you get enough people to pay attention and they see how much you care, they are usually willing
                to help you even a little bit. We wanted to find a way to show people how much of an impact they can have
                without realizing it.
                </br>
                So we are building a thing. It's not done. What you see now is kinda what you'll see when it's finished, but
                there will be more and it'll be different. We gave ourselves a difficult challenge, and we believe that
                if we get enough help we can do it. So we want you to watch us as we try to build our thing.
                </br>
                If we finish building our thing, we'll be proud of what we accomplished. If we fail
                we'll still be proud of what we've learned. We just want to show others that we aren't going to give up.
            </br>
                Come back later and see how we've changed.

        <div id="who" onclick="onoff('who')">
            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <p>We're a bunch of people. Some of us are students, some of us are teachers, some of us are parents, some
            of us aren't. One of us had an idea and they thought is was a good one. So they told it to a couple of
            friends. And a couple more. And a couple more. And many of them thought it was a good idea too and decided
            that they wanted to help. We are all helpers. We are trying to make that one idea come to life. As we get further
                along we'll update. We'll probably change a lot in a short period of time but the goal will be the same.
            </p>

            <h2>It's a Graph</h2>
            <h3>By Jeramey</h3>
            <p>Right now we are at the very beginning of an idea. It's changed a lot in 5 days but one thing has always
            stayed the same and that's the graph. At the center of the graph is a circle all by it's self. This is
                the thing we want to accomplish. All of the circles around it are the helpers. That's us. No one helper
                could get this far alone, it took something from all of us. So as we try to do this thing the number of
                helpers will grow. And the amount of help each gives will grow. And we'll build our thing. And you'll be
                able to watch it all happen on that graph. And once it's finished the graph will change
